**7. Financial Plan**

**Startup Costs (Year 1)**
```
Item	Cost
Production equipment (saws, presses, etc.)	$10,000
Raw materials (bamboo veneers, epoxy, etc.)	$5,000
Rent for facility (first 6 months)	$6,000
Website development /and hosting	$3,000
Marketing and branding	$4,000
Inventory (trucks, wheels, grip tape)	$3,000
Salaries (3 staff for 6 months)	$30,000
Legal, insurance, permits	$2,000
Miscellaneous	$2,000
Total Startup Costs	$65,000
```
**Revenue Projections**

- Skateboards sold per month: 100 units
- Average selling price: $120 per skateboard
- Monthly revenue: 100 x $120 = $12,000
- Annual revenue: $12,000 x 12 months = $144,000

**Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)**

- Bamboo veneers, epoxy, fiberglass per skateboard: $30
- Trucks, wheels, grip tape per skateboard: $40
- Total COGS per skateboard: $70
- Gross profit per skateboard: $120 - $70 = $50

**Operating Expenses (Monthly)**

```
Expense	Cost
Rent	$1,000
Salaries (3 staff)	$5,000
Utilities	$500
Marketing	$1,000
Miscellaneous	$500
Total Operating Expenses	$8,000
```
**Profit & Loss (Year 1)**

**- Revenue (Year 1):** $144,000

**- COGS (Year 1):** 100 units x 12 months x $70 = $84,000

**- Gross Profit (Year 1):** $144,000 - $84,000 = $60,000

**- Operating Expenses (Year 1):** $8,000 x 12 = $96,000

**- Net Profit (Year 1):** $60,000 - $96,000 = ($36,000 loss)

Note: The business is projected to operate at a loss in the first year due to startup costs. However, once initial investments in equipment and marketing are made, profitability should increase in subsequent years.

**Break-even Analysis**

**- Break-even Point:** To break even, the business must cover its total expenses (startup costs + operating expenses). If monthly fixed costs are $8,000 and gross profit per skateboard is $50, the business needs to sell approximately **160 skateboards per month** to break even.

**8. Risk Analysis**

**- Material Sourcing:** Ensure consistent and affordable access to bamboo and other materials.

**- Competition:** Established skateboard brands may have greater brand loyalty.

**- Economic Fluctuations:** In times of economic downturn, discretionary spending on skateboards may decrease.

**9. Conclusion**
EcoRide Bamboo Skateboards has the potential to tap into the growing market for eco-friendly and sustainable products. The initial costs are significant, but with effective marketing and consistent production, the business could achieve profitability within 2-3 years.
